# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

## Overview of Data Structures

Another way to look at data structures is to focus on their strengths and weaknesses.
In this section we’ll provide an overview, in the form of a table, of the major data
storage structures we’ll be discussing in this book. This is a bird’s-eye view of a land-
scape that we’ll be covering later at ground level, so don’t be alarmed if the terms
used are not familiar. Table 1.1 shows the advantages and disadvantages of the
various data structures described in this book.

| Data Structure | Advantages                                        | Disadvantages                            |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Array          | Quick insertion, very fast access if index known. | Slow search, slow deletion,fixed size.   |
| Ordered array  | Quicker search than unsorted array.               | Slow insertion and deletion, fixed size. |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
|                |                                                   |                                          |
