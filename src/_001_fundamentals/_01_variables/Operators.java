         The Java unary operators require only one operand. Unary operators are used to perform various operations i.e.:

         - incrementing/decrementing a value by one
         - negating an expression
         - inverting the value of a boolean

         1) postfix: expr++ expr--
         2) prefix:	++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !

        System.out.println(++x); //12
        System.out.println(x--); //12 (11)
